# crabbox — check verb

## Overview

`crabbox:` probes the [Crabbox](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox) CLI
and its optional local Node.js/PostgreSQL coordinator, served
out-of-process over go-plugin gRPC by `opencharly/plugin-crabbox`.
Install the CLI with `/charly-tools:crabbox-cli` (opencharly/layer-crabbox)
and the coordinator with `/charly-crabbox:crabbox-coordinator`
(opencharly/pod-crabbox).

## Why it is not the `command:`/`http:` verbs

- **Endpoint resolution.** `cc.ResolveEndpoint` turns the in-venue
  coordinator port into a host-reachable address, so one authored step works
  unchanged against a pod's published port and a VM's forwarded one.
- **Domain semantics.** Methods map to the CLI's real surface and return real
  verdicts, with `json_path:` to assert one field.
- **In-venue CLI.** The CLI methods run the `crabbox` binary inside the venue
  over the reverse channel — `http:` cannot reach the CLI at all.

## Methods

| Group | Methods |
|---|---|
| In-venue CLI — credential-free | `version` (`crabbox --version`) `providers` (`crabbox providers`) `config` (`crabbox config show`) `doctor` (`crabbox doctor` — needs NO broker configured, or a REACHABLE one) |
| Coordinator HTTP probe (host-side, port 8080) | `health` (`/v1/health`) `ready` (`/v1/ready`) |
| In-venue CLI — broker-backed (requires `crabbox login` in the venue) | `leases` (`crabbox list` — the ID/NAME/STATE/TYPE/IP inventory) `usage` (`crabbox usage`) `events` (`crabbox events <run_id>`) `logs` (`crabbox logs <run_id>`) |

Per-lease state is `crabbox status <id-or-slug>` — *"Show lease state; add
`--wait` to block until ready"*. It is deliberately NOT this verb's `leases`
method: `status` is not an enumerator, and it has **no `--all` flag** (measured
on the pinned v0.79.0: `crabbox status --all` exits *"flag provided but not
defined: -all"*), so the earlier prose that documented `leases` as
`crabbox status --all` named a command that cannot run.

All methods are read-only — there are no mutating methods in this first cut.

## Input fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `method` | the operation (also the scalar-sugar primary: `crabbox: version`) |
| `port` | coordinator port for health/ready probes (default 8080) |
| `timeout` | HTTP probe timeout (default 10s) |
| `json_path` | dotted path into the response; stdout becomes that value |
| `run_id` | run identifier for the `events`/`logs` methods |
| `provider` | the provider to select for the methods whose CLI command DEFINES `--provider` (`doctor`, `leases`) |

## Scalar shorthand

```yaml
crabbox: version          # scalar sugar
crabbox:                  # map form — identical meaning
  method: version
```

The sugar is enabled by this candy's `plugin.primary: {crabbox: method}`,
which charly reads in a PRE-CONNECT prescan — so the plugin candy must be
composed into the box that authors the step.

## Credential-free vs broker-backed

`version`/`providers`/`config`/`doctor` work with no coordinator and no
login (fresh HOME). `leases`/`usage`/`events`/`logs` talk to the configured
broker — the venue must hold a prior `crabbox login` (shared-token:
`crabbox login --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --token-stdin`). `doctor` exits
nonzero when a broker is configured but unreachable — gate it on
coordinator readiness first.

## Selecting a provider

`provider:` is passed through as `--provider <name>` for the two methods whose CLI
command defines the flag — `doctor` and `leases` (`crabbox list`) — and nowhere
else, because attaching it to a command that does not define it is an argument
error, not a selection. Measured on the pinned v0.79.0:

```
$ crabbox doctor --provider local-container   -> ok provider-selection provider=local-container source=flag selected=true
$ crabbox list   --provider aws              -> the ID/NAME/STATE/TYPE/IP inventory
$ crabbox usage  --provider aws              -> flag provided but not defined: -provider
$ crabbox providers --provider aws           -> flag provided but not defined: -provider
```

Unset, the CLI keeps its own configured/ambient selection — which is what every
step got before this input existed, so an authored step that does not name a
provider behaves exactly as it did.
