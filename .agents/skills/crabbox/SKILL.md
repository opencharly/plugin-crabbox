# crabbox — check verb

## Overview

`crabbox:` probes the [Crabbox](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox) CLI
and its optional local Node.js/PostgreSQL coordinator, served
out-of-process over go-plugin gRPC by `opencharly/plugin-crabbox`.
Install the CLI with `/charly-tools:crabbox-cli` (opencharly/layer-crabbox)
and the coordinator with `/charly-crabbox:crabbox-coordinator`
(opencharly/pod-crabbox).

## Why it is not the `command:`/`http:` verbs

- **Endpoint resolution.** `cc.ResolveEndpoint` turns the in-venue
  coordinator port into a host-reachable address, so one authored step works
  unchanged against a pod's published port and a VM's forwarded one.
- **Domain semantics.** Methods map to the CLI's real surface and return real
  verdicts, with `json_path:` to assert one field.
- **In-venue CLI.** The CLI methods run the `crabbox` binary inside the venue
  over the reverse channel — `http:` cannot reach the CLI at all.

## Methods

| Group | Methods |
|---|---|
| In-venue CLI — credential-free | `version` (`crabbox --version`) `providers` (`crabbox providers`) `describe` (`crabbox providers describe <name> --json`) `config` (`crabbox config show`) `doctor` (`crabbox doctor` — needs NO broker configured, or a REACHABLE one) |
| In-venue gate — containerd | `containerd-preflight` (read-only dependency probe for a containerd lease; PASS or a visible SKIP naming the exact absent dependency) |
| Coordinator HTTP probe (host-side, port 8080) | `health` (`/v1/health`) `ready` (`/v1/ready`) |
| In-venue CLI — broker-backed (requires `crabbox login` in the venue) | `leases` (`crabbox list` — the ID/NAME/STATE/TYPE/IP inventory) `usage` (`crabbox usage`) `events` (`crabbox events <run_id>`) `logs` (`crabbox logs <run_id>`) |

Per-lease state is `crabbox status <id-or-slug>` — *"Show lease state; add
`--wait` to block until ready"*. It is deliberately NOT this verb's `leases`
method: `status` is not an enumerator, and it has **no `--all` flag** (measured
on the pinned v0.79.0: `crabbox status --all` exits *"flag provided but not
defined: -all"*), so the earlier prose that documented `leases` as
`crabbox status --all` named a command that cannot run.

All methods are read-only with respect to LEASES — none creates, mutates, or
releases one. `containerd-preflight`'s only write is a `nerdctl pull` of the
configured lease image, which proves the ref exists in a registry instead of
trusting a local cache.

## `describe` — the provider's own description

`describe` takes the provider as its **positional** argument (that CLI command has
no `--provider` flag) and asks for JSON:

```
crabbox providers describe containerd --json
{"provider":{"requested":"containerd","canonical":"containerd",...},"kind":"ssh-lease","runnable":true,...}
```

Assert one field with `json_path:` (e.g. `provider.canonical`, `kind`, `runnable`)
rather than pattern-matching the document. A provider the CLI does not have exits
non-zero and the step FAILS — an unknown name is an authoring error, not a skip.

## `containerd-preflight` — the visible skip for an absent dependency

A containerd lease needs a CLI that carries the provider, a reachable daemon, the
kernel's `xt_multiport` match (the CNI portmap hook publishes the lease SSH port),
and a pullable lease image. When any is absent the preflight returns `skip` with the
first missing dependency named:

- `the in-venue crabbox CLI (version …) does not list the containerd provider` — the
  venue's `layer-crabbox` predates the source build of `opencharly/crabbox`;
- `the containerd daemon at <address> (namespace …) is not reachable: …`;
- `the kernel has no xt_multiport match … (opencharly/layer-containerd#5)`;
- `the lease image <ref> is not present and cannot be pulled: …`.

A provider that IS present but cannot describe itself, or a CLI whose `providers`
command fails, is a FAIL, not a skip. Never author a bed that runs a lease without
this gate: a `run:` step has no conditional SKIP, so the gate is what keeps the leg
honest while a dependency is missing.

## Input fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `method` | the operation (also the scalar-sugar primary: `crabbox: version`) |
| `port` | coordinator port for health/ready probes (default 8080) |
| `timeout` | HTTP probe timeout (default 10s) |
| `json_path` | dotted path into the response; stdout becomes that value |
| `run_id` | run identifier for the `events`/`logs` methods |
| `provider` | the provider to select for the methods whose CLI command DEFINES `--provider` (`doctor`, `leases`), and the positional name for `describe` |
| `containerd` | the containerd provider's own keys, passed as `--containerd-<key> <value>` on `doctor`/`leases`, and read by `containerd-preflight` (address, namespace, runtime, image) |
| `firecracker` | the firecracker provider's own keys, passed as `--firecracker-<key> <value>` on `doctor`/`leases` |

## Scalar shorthand

```yaml
crabbox: version          # scalar sugar
crabbox:                  # map form — identical meaning
  method: version
```

The sugar is enabled by this candy's `plugin.primary: {crabbox: method}`,
which charly reads in a PRE-CONNECT prescan — so the plugin candy must be
composed into the box that authors the step.

## Credential-free vs broker-backed

`version`/`providers`/`config`/`doctor` work with no coordinator and no
login (fresh HOME). `leases`/`usage`/`events`/`logs` talk to the configured
broker — the venue must hold a prior `crabbox login` (shared-token:
`crabbox login --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --token-stdin`). `doctor` exits
nonzero when a broker is configured but unreachable — gate it on
coordinator readiness first.

## Selecting a provider

`provider:` is passed through as `--provider <name>` for the two methods whose CLI
command defines the flag — `doctor` and `leases` (`crabbox list`) — and becomes the
POSITIONAL argument for `describe` (`providers describe <name>`); it is attached
nowhere else, because attaching it to a command that does not define it is an
argument error, not a selection. Measured on the release the org previously pinned
(v0.79.0) and on the source build of `opencharly/crabbox` b7b5aaa3:

```
$ crabbox doctor --provider local-container   -> ok provider-selection provider=local-container source=flag selected=true
$ crabbox list   --provider aws              -> the ID/NAME/STATE/TYPE/IP inventory
$ crabbox usage  --provider aws              -> flag provided but not defined: -provider
$ crabbox providers --provider aws           -> flag provided but not defined: -provider
$ crabbox providers describe containerd --json -> {"provider":{"canonical":"containerd",...},"kind":"ssh-lease",...}
```

The `containerd:` block rides the SAME allowlist as `--provider` (`doctor`,
`leases`), because those are the commands that define `--containerd-*`; it is never
appended to `providers` or `describe`.

Unset, the CLI keeps its own configured/ambient selection — which is what every
step got before this input existed, so an authored step that does not name a
provider behaves exactly as it did.

## The config candy

`opencharly/layer-crabbox` ships a SEPARATE candy, `crabbox-containerd-config`,
that renders `~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml`:

```yaml
provider: containerd
containerd:
    image: ghcr.io/opencharly/pod-crabbox:2026.293.1655
```

It is referenced by path
(`@github.com/opencharly/layer-crabbox/candy/crabbox-containerd-config:<tag>`) so
the root `crabbox` candy keeps its meaning for every current consumer, and the
rendered bytes are validated against plugin-egress's `crabbox-yaml` schema.
